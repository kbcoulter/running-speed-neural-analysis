# running-speed-neural-analysis
Limited influence of running speed on neuronal activity in mice visual cortex subregions: a comparative study using linear regression and binned analyses

This repository contains the final project/analysis for Biology 4/510: Analysis of Neural Data at the University of Oregon. The project examines the influence of running speed on neuronal activity in mouse visual cortex subregions using linear regression and binned analyses. While the core methods, analyses, the majority of the code, and results remain true to the original class project, I’ve adjusted some figures to better align with my preferences for accessible visualizations and/or figures.

# What’s Included:
- A Single Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) script for data analysis and figure generation (per project requirements)
- Full PDF report including figures
- PDF report without figures
- Folder containing .png figures (Identical to those generated by the Jupyter Notebook)

# Maintenance & Feedback:
Feel free to reach out if you run into any issues, have suggestions, or believe this repo needs updates. I’m happy to maintain this repo if needed/ desired.
